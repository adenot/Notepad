## Startup update

My friends and family always ask me "How's your startup?" and my answer has been the same over the past few weeks: "Still building the product". Since this answer is boring, I will try to describe in a more interesting way here.

## 21/04/2015
Quit my job for almost 2 weeks now, after a mixed period that started in the start of this year of working part time, taking unpaid leave and full time.

My [product](http://www.spikenode.com) is a hard one to design, it's something different from what's in the market so every decision I have to make is completely based on my experiences and biases, which are prone to mistakes.

Current status is:
